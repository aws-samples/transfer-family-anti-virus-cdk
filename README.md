## Introduction

This user guide is created for anyone who is interested in detecting malware threats using [AWS Transfer Family](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-transfer-family/) as it is a popular choice for secure file transfer tailor-made for [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/).

[Transfer Family managed workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/transfer-workflows.html) empower you to process files through preset actions, including copying, tagging, decrypting, and even custom preprocessing via AWS Lambda. This offers flexibility, allowing you to integrate your specific code for tasks like malicious content detection, PII obfuscation, data encryption, and alert generation. Upon file upload completion, Transfer Family's managed workflows initiate automatically, forwarding logs to Amazon CloudWatch.

This guide provides the steps to set up a workflow that leverages [Clam Antivirus (ClamAV)](https://www.clamav.net/) â€” a renowned open-source antivirus engine proficient in detecting a myriad of threats such as trojans, malware, and viruses with periodic updates to virus definitions to remain abreast of emerging threats.

Following this guide, you should be able to:
- Familiarize ypurself with managed workflow on AWS Transfer Family to detect the malware.
- Learn ways to detect those threats and quarantine using antivirus.
- Deploy ClamAV with AWS Lambda and continuously update ClamAV virus definitions.

## Malware threats in file transfers
The reliable transfer of files via SFTP, FTP, and FTPS protocols remains foundational in many business-to-business (B2B) operations. Across various sectors, businesses rely on file transfers to relay information such as inventory, invoicing, and compliance data. There may be presence of malicious content in these files which can create financial repercussions and damage to the brand image.

You can deploy the malware detection in the context of file transfers, so that you can screen every incoming file, separating any harmful content before it infiltrates the main systems. Only after a comprehensive security verification, encompassing tools like antivirus scans, should new files be integrated into your systems.

## Solution Overview
This design blueprint outlines the setup of a Transfer Family server integrated with a managed workflow that employs ClamAV for scanning every file upon upload. While this particular server utilizes the SFTP protocol to relay files to Amazon S3, it's worth noting that the workflows are adaptable and can support SFTP, FTPS, and FTP protocols within Transfer Family servers, and they can facilitate transfers to Amazon EFS as well. The example here focuses on file transfers directed towards Amazon S3 and incorporates a workflow tailored for real-time file scanning. Moreover, it's feasible to integrate the ClamAV scanning phase into existing workflows. A practical application could be decrypting the file initially, followed by a ClamAV scan. An added advantage of this blueprint is its provision for automatic updates of both the ClamAV codebase and its virus definitions, ensuring the scanning mechanism remains contemporary without necessitating manual intervention. The subsequent illustration delineates the sequence of operations required to authenticate the Transfer Family server, initiate a file upload, trigger the managed workflow, and consistently refresh the virus definitions.

Figure 1. Detect Malware Threats using AWS Transfer Family - Reference Architecture


1. User sends an authentication request to the [AWS Transfer Family](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-transfer-family) server which forwards the request to authenticate the user using a custom identity provider.
2. [AWS Transfer Family](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-transfer-family) service sends user credentials, protocol, and IP address to AWS Lambda Function, using SSH key-based authentication if no password is provided.
3. [AWS Lambda function](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/) `Authentication` sends query to AWS Secret manager for authentication.
4. [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) stores user credentials, including password, Identity Access Management (IAM) role mapping, SSH key data, source IP CIDRs and directory mappings.
5. `Authentication` Lambda function verifies the login and sends user-specific configurations to AWS Transfer Family service.
6. The user uploads their file(s) to the AWS Transfer Family server. Each file is put into an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) bucket and invokes a distinct Transfer Family managed workflow execution.
7. The [AWS Transfer Family managed workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/transfer-workflows.html) initializes a sequence of processing steps configured. In that workflow step, the `ClamAV` AWS Lambda function scans each file using [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) installed container image.
8. Based on the scan result from the `ClamAV` AWS Lambda function, the managed workflow tags the scanned files appropriately either as `INFECTED` or `CLEAN` in the same S3 bucket as in Step 6. 
9. An [AWS EventBridge Scheduler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/what-is-scheduler.html) rule is configured to run based on a CRON expression to update the ClamAV container image and virus definitions periodically.
10. [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) builds ClamAV container image, adds the latest relevant virus definitions and uploads it to [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).
11. The `Update ClamAV` AWS Lambda function pulls the built container image from Amazon ECR and updates the `ClamAV` AWS Lambda function which is a part of the managed workflow.

The guidance encompasses several integrated components, with the Transfer Family's managed workflow involving various stages, such as custom Lambda functions and tagging - all triggered by a singular event. Should there be alterations in the state during any of these stages, it requires corresponding adjustments in the following steps. For example, if there's a customized procedure that decompresses a file and redirects it to a fresh Amazon S3 prefix, it's imperative to reconfigure the ClamAV image to reference the updated path.

## Post Deployment Steps

You can test the end-to-end configuration by following these steps:

1. Uploading a clean file via the SFTP endpoint, using user name and password obtained from Steps 6 and 7 in the the [Deployment](#deployment-steps) section.
```
sftp randomusername01@s-XXXXXXXXXXXXX.server.transfer.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
randomusername01@s-XXXXXXXXXXXXX.server.transfer.us-west-2.amazonaws.com's password: <enter password from Step 7> 
....
```
After authentication to the SFTP endpoint, use any available SFTP client (e.g. FileZilla, CyberDuck etc.) to upload file for virus scanning
```
sftp> put /Users/username/downloads/sample-business.zip 
Uploading /Users/username/downloads/sample-business.zip to /clamav-scan-landingzone-doqmume6ih9v/sample-business.zip
sample-business.zip                                            100%   25MB  30.3MB/s   00:00    
sftp> put /Users/username/downloads/pay_statements.zip
Uploading /Users/username/downloads/pay_statements.zip to /clamav-scan-landingzone-doqmume6ih9v/pay_statements.zip
pay_statements.zip                                             100%   15KB 193.7KB/s   00:00
```

2. **The managed transfer workflow is executed in a few seconds, and the S3 object in the ClamAV-scan-landing zone-* bucket is tagged as CLEAN. It should now accessible for download**
   ![Figure 6: Screen capture of the Amazon S3 Object tag for a clean file](./images/Picture6.png)
